You are the Commander of this ship.|
Your current mission is to simply follow orders. Things will get hairy, and things will get boring. But you know it will always be alright.|
This ship is amazing. Practically impregnable, enough luxuries to get the crew through even years at a time.|
For now this sector of the galaxy is at peace. You are a part of the dominant clan, in command of one of their noble flagships. This is pretty much a vacation.|
